# Advanced Level - Python Mastery 🔥

Welcome to advanced Python! These concepts will make your code more elegant, efficient, and professional.

## Programs in This Level

### 1. Decorators (`01_decorators.py`)
- Understand the decorator pattern in Python
- Create function decorators to modify behavior
- Learn about parameterized decorators
- Explore class-based decorators and practical applications

### 2. Generators and Iterators (`02_generators_and_iterators.py`)
- Create memory-efficient iterators with generators
- Understand the `yield` keyword and lazy evaluation
- Build custom iterator classes
- Create generator pipelines for data processing

### 3. Context Managers (`03_context_managers.py`)
- Master the `with` statement for resource management
- Create custom context managers using classes
- Use `@contextmanager` decorator for simpler implementations
- Handle exceptions in context managers

## Advanced Concepts Covered

- **Decorators**: Function modification, timing, caching, logging
- **Generators**: Memory-efficient iteration, infinite sequences
- **Context Managers**: Resource management, temporary state changes
- **Advanced Patterns**: Pipeline processing, lazy evaluation

## Prerequisites

Before tackling this level, ensure you're comfortable with:
- Object-oriented programming concepts
- Exception handling
- File operations
- Function definitions and scope

## Real-World Applications

These concepts are used in:

1. **Web Frameworks**: Flask/Django use decorators extensively
2. **Data Processing**: Generators for handling large datasets
3. **Database Connections**: Context managers for connection handling
4. **API Development**: Decorators for authentication and rate limiting
5. **File Processing**: Generators for reading large files efficiently

## Practice Challenges

1. **Timing Decorator**: Create a decorator that measures function execution time
2. **Caching System**: Build a memoization decorator for expensive functions
3. **File Processor**: Use generators to process large CSV files line by line
4. **Database Context Manager**: Create a context manager for database transactions

## Next Steps

Ready for **Expert** level when you can:
- Write and use decorators effectively
- Create generators for memory-efficient processing
- Implement custom context managers
- Understand when and why to use these patterns

Advance to **Expert** level for multithreading, APIs, and design patterns! 🚀
