# Beginner Level - Python Fundamentals 🌱

Welcome to the beginning of your Python journey! This level covers the essential building blocks of Python programming.

## Programs in This Level

### 1. Variables and Data Types (`01_variables_and_data_types.py`)
- Learn about Python's basic data types: strings, integers, floats, booleans
- Understand variable assignment and reassignment
- Explore Python's dynamic typing system

### 2. Input and Output (`02_input_and_output.py`)
- Get user input with the `input()` function
- Display output using `print()` and string formatting
- Learn about f-strings and `.format()` method

### 3. Conditional Statements (`03_conditionals.py`)
- Make decisions in your code with `if`, `elif`, `else`
- Understand comparison operators
- Practice with nested conditions

### 4. Loops (`04_loops.py`)
- Repeat code execution with `for` and `while` loops
- Use `range()` function for number sequences
- Control loop flow with `break` and `continue`

### 5. Functions (`05_functions.py`)
- Create reusable code blocks with functions
- Understand parameters, arguments, and return values
- Learn about default parameters and variable scope

## Learning Tips

1. **Run each program** - Don't just read the code, execute it!
2. **Experiment** - Try changing values and see what happens
3. **Practice** - Create your own variations of these programs
4. **Take notes** - Write down key concepts as you learn

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with all beginner concepts:
- Can you create variables of different types?
- Can you write if-else statements confidently?
- Can you create and use functions?
- Can you write both for and while loops?

If yes, you're ready for the **Intermediate** level! 🎉
