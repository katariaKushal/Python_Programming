# Intermediate Level - Data Structures & OOP 🚀

Ready to level up? This section introduces more complex concepts that are essential for real-world Python programming.

## Programs in This Level

### 1. Lists and Dictionaries (`01_lists_and_dictionaries.py`)
- Master Python's most important data structures
- Learn list operations: append, insert, remove, slicing
- Understand dictionaries: keys, values, and nested structures
- Practice with list comprehensions

### 2. Classes and Objects (`02_classes_and_objects.py`)
- Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Create classes with `__init__` constructors
- Understand instance vs class variables
- Learn about inheritance and method overriding

### 3. File Handling (`03_file_handling.py`)
- Read from and write to files safely
- Use the `with` statement for proper file handling
- Process structured data (CSV format)
- Handle file-related errors gracefully

### 4. Error Handling (`04_error_handling.py`)
- Handle errors gracefully with try/except blocks
- Create custom exception classes
- Use finally blocks for cleanup
- Learn about assertions for debugging

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, nested structures
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance
- **File I/O**: Reading, writing, and processing files
- **Error Handling**: Exception handling and custom exceptions

## Prerequisites

Before starting this level, make sure you understand:
- Variables and basic data types
- Functions and their usage
- Control flow (if statements, loops)

## Practice Projects

Try building these mini-projects to reinforce your learning:

1. **Student Grade Manager**: Use classes to represent students and manage their grades
2. **File-based Todo List**: Create a todo list that saves to and loads from a file
3. **Simple Contact Book**: Store contacts in a dictionary and save to JSON file

## Next Steps

Ready for **Advanced** level when you can:
- Create and use classes confidently
- Handle files and exceptions properly
- Work with complex data structures
- Understand inheritance and method overriding

Move on to **Advanced** level for decorators, generators, and more! 🎯
